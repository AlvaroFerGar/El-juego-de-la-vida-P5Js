This project is a fork of [Mario Roos Hoefgeest's implementation](https://github.com/mariorht/El-juego-de-la-vida-P5Js) of John Conway's "Game of Life," using the p5.js library. Kudos to my friend and colleague Mario ü§ô

# ü¶† Changes to the original Game of Life.

* Cells inherit **colors** from their neighbors based on probability.
* The most common neighboring color has the highest chance of being inherited.
* Each neighbor contributes equally (1/8 weight) to color calculations.

* **Modified survival rules:** living cells need 3/8 neighbors to *maybe* change its color.
* **Modified survival rules:** once a cell is alive it wouldn't die, it will only change colors.
* **Modified birth rules:** dead cells need 1/8 neighbors to *maybe* came alive.
* **Border cells** affect diagonal connections and neighborhood calculations

# üïπÔ∏è How to play

Configure your canvas with *RESTART*, *CLEAR* and the different brushes.
Use the *PLAY* and *PAUSE* buttons to control the game, adjusting the game speed using the slider.
